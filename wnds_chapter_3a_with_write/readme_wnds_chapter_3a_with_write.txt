readme_wnds_chapter_3a_with_write.txt

This directory contains an expanded version of the initial jump-start program from chapter 3 of Web and Network Data Science, the program that uses the requests and Beautiful Soup packages.

Place the entire directory on your desktop and open it. 

Drag the program file 

wnds_chapter_3a_with_write.py

into the Enthought Canopy editor window and ensure that the working directory is set to the directory of the program file.

Running the entire program in Canopy should produce the text file 

my_file.txt

which can then be opened in your favorite text editor (e.g. notepad++ in Windows).
